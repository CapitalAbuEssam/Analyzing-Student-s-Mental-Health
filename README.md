# Analyzing-Student-s-Mental-Health
This is a simple Data Analysis Project on the study conducted by A Japanese international university in 2018 where it wanted to analyze student's mental health when they studied abroad and what other parameters affected their mental health. It was fully done by SQL with it being my first guided project from Datacamp that I took on the topic of data analysis.
